Deribit API V2 Client for Rust Language
=================

This is experimental and currently under heavy development. Use at your own risk.

This library uses Rust nightly features extensively like async/await and futures api. You need a nightly Rust to make it run.

The current plan is to only implement the websocket communication, which includes call api through websocket 
and websocket subscription. I will first implement these APIs used for my own trading purpose, however, if you want some APIs 
to be prioritly implemented please open an issue or just throw me a PR (this is more welcome :P).
